# unitConverter_C


# In this project, I will write code to convert any menstruation unit from one system to another. E.g., convert degree Fahrenheit to Celsius or convert kilometer to a # mile. You can add as many systems as you want besides common systems such as temperature, distance, time, currency (using approximate rate), and mass.
